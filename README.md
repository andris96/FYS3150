# FYS3150

This is my repository for projects in FYS3150 - Computational physics. Each project has its own folder which includes code, tex and pdf file for each project. 

For project 1, you have to run "g++ problem2.cpp -o problem2.exe" and "g++ problem7.cpp -o problem7.exe" and run "./problem2.exe" and "./problem7.exe" in order to get the relevant output files. Then run "python plotting.py" to get the plots.

For project 2, the compiling and running instructions are given in each c++ program, but also here:

Problem 3
to compile: g++ problem3_main.cpp src/functions.cpp -I include -o problem3_main.exe -larmadillo

to run: ./problem3_main.exe

Problem 4
to compile: g++ problem4_main.cpp src/functions.cpp -I include -o problem4_main.exe -larmadillo

to run: ./problem4_main.exe

Problem 5
to compile: g++ problem5_main.cpp src/functions.cpp -I include -o problem5_main.exe -larmadillo

to run: ./problem5_main.exe

Problem 6
to compile: g++ problem6_main.cpp src/functions.cpp -I include -o problem6_main.exe -larmadillo

to run: ./problem6_main.exe

Problem 7a
to compile: g++ problem7a_main.cpp src/functions.cpp -I include -o problem7a_main.exe -larmadillo

to run: ./problem7a_main.exe

Problem 7b
to compile: g++ problem7b_main.cpp src/functions.cpp -I include -o problem7b_main.exe -larmadillo

to run: ./problem7b_main.exe

for the python plots: python3 iterations_plot.py, python3 problem7a.plot.py, python3 problem7b.plot.py
