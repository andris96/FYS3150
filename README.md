# FYS3150

This is my repository for projects in FYS3150 - Computational physics. Each project has its own folder which includes code, tex and pdf file for each project. 

For project 1, you have to run "g++ problem2.cpp -o problem2.exe" and "g++ problem7.cpp -o problem7.exe" and run "./problem2.exe" and "./problem7.exe" in order to get the relevant output files. Then run "python plotting.py" to get the plots.
