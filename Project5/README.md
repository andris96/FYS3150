Welcome to Project 5. Below are the instructions for running each program related to this project. This time it is very simple: run main.exe to get all results, and run plot.py to get all the relevant plots. The code is spesified to the problems in this project, and is therefore not very dynamic when it comes to running different configurations. As time is short, we did not implement in such a way that one could give input from the commandline or a file.

To build: g++ main.cpp src/functions.cpp -I include -o main.exe -larmadillo

To run: ./main.exe

To run the python program:

python3 plot.py
